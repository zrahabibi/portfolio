üöÄ About The Project

The goal of this project was to create a modern, flexible, and high-performance portfolio system. By decoupling the frontend from the backend (a "headless" approach), we achieve several key advantages:

Performance: The Svelte.js frontend is incredibly fast and lightweight, providing a superior user experience.

Flexibility: The content is managed in the user-friendly WordPress interface, but the frontend can be rebuilt or swapped out with any technology without affecting the content.

Security: The attack surface is reduced as the frontend and backend are separate entities.

Developer Experience: Combines the world's most popular CMS for content management with a modern JavaScript framework for building interfaces.

üéØ Key Features

Headless Architecture: Content is managed in WordPress and served via its REST API.

Blazing-Fast Frontend: Built with SvelteKit for an optimal, snappy user experience.

AI-Powered Content Assistance: Integrated AI helps generate project descriptions directly in the WordPress editor.

Multi-Language & RTL Support: Fully functional in English and Persian (Farsi) with a seamless language switcher and correct Right-to-Left (RTL) layout.

Fully Responsive: A "mobile-first" design that looks great on all devices, from phones to desktops.

Automated Backups: A nightly cron job automatically backs up the MySQL database.

Custom WordPress Development: Includes a custom child theme and a simple shortcode plugin.

üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap & Learning Path

This project was developed in distinct phases to build skills incrementally.

‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundations and Setup

Set up the complete local development environment (XAMPP, Git, VSCode).

Installed WordPress on the local Apache server.

‚úÖ Phase 2: WordPress as a Headless CMS

Created a custom post type "Projects".

Used the ACF plugin to define custom fields (description, tech, URL, images).

Populated the CMS with sample project data.

‚úÖ Phase 3: Svelte.js Frontend

Initialized a new SvelteKit project.

Fetched data from the WordPress REST API using AJAX requests.

Created Svelte components to display the project data.

‚úÖ Phase 4: Design, Styling, and Responsiveness

Designed the UI/UX in Figma.

Styled the frontend using TailwindCSS for layout and Bootstrap for components.

Added subtle animations, hovers, and transitions.

Ensured a fully responsive, mobile-first design.

‚úÖ Phase 5: Advanced Features

Implemented multi-language support for Persian (Farsi) by duplicating ACF fields.

Created a language switcher on the frontend.

Applied custom CSS for proper Right-to-Left (RTL) layout.

‚úÖ Phase 6: AI and Automation

Integrated a text-generation AI API to suggest project descriptions within the WordPress editor.

Set up a local cron job to run a PHP script for nightly database backups.

‚úÖ Phase 7: Custom WordPress Development

Created a simple child theme to safely customize styles.

Developed a basic plugin to provide a [project_count] shortcode.
